    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am ambitious as a person, so I naturally seek to learn something new as much as possible
        because in development and programming field it is very important to keep up with new trends and
        technology. It helps alot in career transition if necesary. so its very important to stay ahead with the
        knowledge.
        there is always somethng new to learn in programming, you just simply cannot learn everything, so it helps in
        keepning
        as a student of the field.
